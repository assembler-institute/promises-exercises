 * Finish the code of the `exercise10` function bellow

 * 1. Receives a parameter named `promise` that is a Promise
 *
 * 2. The function should be of type `async`
 *
 * 3. The function should `await` for the response of the
 *    `promise` parameter which means that you will
 *     need to execute it and await for the result.
 *
 * 4. The result of calling `await` should be stored in a variable
 *    which you will have to pass as an argument to console.log
